This is our team's final project while we were participating in Adjacent Academies' 2021 Summer Coding Bootcamp. 
We created a website called the "Website Template Generator". Our website allowed users to create their own simple home page by choosing certain elements such as 
background color, font color, heading, paragraph, etc., and the generated website will appear for the user to see. We also allowed the code behind the generated website to appear on the screen.
